Why we should all learn how to code!
Hello, I'm Rachelle. I plan on changing careers by gravitating awat from technical support to front-end development.  My goal is to learn HTML, CSS and Javascript in the next 60 days.  I realize this is a lofty goal, especially since I have a full-time job, but I'm passionate and I only need about 4 hours of sleep to function!
